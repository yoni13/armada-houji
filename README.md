> [!WARNING]
> Armada is prototype software under active development. Installation requires
> bootloader changes that can brick a device, corrupt partitions, or cause data
> loss. Check the current [supported-device list](https://armadaos.dev/devices/supported-devices/),
> back up your data, and read the complete [installation guide](https://armadaos.dev/getting-started/flashing-to-an-sd-card/)
> before proceeding.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ## This fork adds an unofficial, experimental Xiaomi 14 (houji) port
>
> **Not part of upstream Armada.** It is not on the
> [supported-device list](https://armadaos.dev/devices/supported-devices/), and the
> install guides above **do not apply** to it.
>
> - **Different install path.** It boots with the phone's **stock, unlocked Xiaomi
>   bootloader**, not Armada's modified ABL, and installs to internal storage with
>   its own tools.
> - **A fresh install erases all data on the phone.** The bootloader must already
>   be unlocked, and must never be relocked while this is installed.
> - **Mostly AI-written, tested on one phone.** An AI coding agent did most of the
>   porting while the owner tested on real hardware. Expect rough edges, and
>   review the changes before flashing.
> - **Not everything works.** Sleep is experimental, and cellular, cameras and
>   fingerprint are missing.
>
> **Read the [Xiaomi 14 guide](ports/houji/README.md) before building or flashing.**
> It has the feature status, known issues, and build and install steps. The
> engineering history is in [HISTORY.md](ports/houji/HISTORY.md).

## About Armada

Armada is a gaming-focused Linux distribution built on
[Fedora bootc](https://github.com/bootc-dev/bootc) with device support derived
from [ROCKNIX](https://github.com/ROCKNIX). It combines a console-first Steam
experience with a full KDE Plasma desktop while remaining an open, image-based
operating system.

Highlights include:

- ARM64 Steam with FEX translation and Proton compatibility
- Gaming Mode and a full KDE Plasma Desktop Mode
- Over-the-air operating system updates
- SD-card boot with optional internal-storage installation
- Handheld-focused power, fan, controller, and calibration controls
- Per-game compatibility settings through Armada Control

## Documentation

The [Armada documentation](https://armadaos.dev/) is the source of truth for
device support, installation, updates, current limitations, and recovery. Use
the guides there rather than instructions copied from older releases or posts.

## Development

This repository assembles the Armada bootc image and its flashable disk images,
along with the upstream-derived packages it ships (see
[`packages/`](packages/README.md)). The development recipes require
[just](https://just.systems/) and [Podman](https://podman.io/):

```console
$ just check     # Run the test suite and check recipe formatting
$ just packages  # Build the packages the image consumes (slow from cold)
$ just build     # Build the local bootc container image
$ just --list    # Show disk-image, VM, and other development recipes
```

Each package builds as a stage in `packages/Containerfile` and is published
under a tag derived from its own sources, so an unchanged package is never
rebuilt. `just build` uses a locally built package when you have one and the
published image otherwise, so you only build what you are changing.

Issues and pull requests are welcome. For installation or device support, check
the [troubleshooting documentation](https://armadaos.dev/troubleshooting/frequently-asked-questions/)
or ask in the [Armada Discord community](https://discord.gg/HdmdSxTD5S).

The experimental Xiaomi 14 port is documented in its own
[guide](ports/houji/README.md); see the notice at the top of this page first.
